JNDI Kit
========

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/realityforge/jndikit.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/realityforge/jndikit)

JNDI Kit is a toolkit designed to help with the construction of JNDI providers. The toolkit also provides
users with ready made memory-based and RMI-based contexts.

Download the jar from maven central. This can be done by adding a Maven dependency such as;

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.realityforge.proxy-servlet</groupId>
   <artifactId>proxy-servlet</artifactId>
   <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Note: JNDI Kit has jumped through a number of open source organisaztions and has accepted a contribution from
Tim Anderson before landing at it's current location.
