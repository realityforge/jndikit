JNDI Kit is a toolkit designed to help with the construction of JNDI providers. The toolkit also provides
users with ready made memory-based and RMI-based contexts.

Note: JNDI Kit has jumped through a number of open source organisaztions and has accepted a contribution from
Tim Anderson before landing at it's current location.
